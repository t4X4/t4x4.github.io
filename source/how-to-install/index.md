All of my repacks are packaged in a zip store format, to extract them use a tool like <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/"> 7Zip </a> <br>
Once you have done that you can run the batch file titled "Verify install files" to verify that you downloaded a non-corupted version of my repack, this is a feature only included in my newer repacks. After that you are free to launch the "Setup.exe" and follow the on-screen instrucions.<br>

If you have issues running the game, make sure that you installed everything in the "_Redists Install before playing!" folder in the root of the game installation.
